# PROJECT_BRIEF.md — Archived

> **This document is superseded.** The canonical architecture reference is **[PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md](./PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

This file was the original project brief from the pre-S2PX era (when the app was called "S2P Studio" and used Firestore/Cloud SQL). It references outdated architecture, old GCP projects, and a different backend structure.

**Current documentation:**

| [README.md](./README.md) | Project overview, getting started, feature map |
| [PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md](./PRODUCT_ARCHITECTURE.md) | Full architecture reference (schema, API routes, engine, types) |
