# PART II: SALES & CLIENT JOURNEY

## Buyer Personas

Understanding the specific drivers of our 7 key personas is critical for all internal messaging and alignment:

1. **Executive / Principal:** Wants risk reduction and repeatable outcomes; driven by reducing liability exposure.
2. **CFO / Finance:** Wants predictable costs and transparent pricing methodology; needs to defend vendor selection.
3. **Architect / Designer (Core Buyer):** Wants design control and legible deliverables; needs to start designing immediately without model cleanup.
4. **Project Manager:** Wants on-time handoffs and scope lock; driven by deadline adherence.
5. **Engineer -- Structural:** Wants defensible dimensional data and declared tolerances for load calculations.
6. **Engineer -- MEP / Sustainability:** Wants accurate routing and sizing thresholds, often for compliance/decarbonization baselining.
7. **Procurement / Vendor Approval:** Wants comparability across bids and complete security/insurance documentation.
