## 📦 Section 9: Services, Deliverables & Coverage
Core Services
- Scan-to-BIM (Primary): LiDAR capture (interior + exterior) with Trimble X7, point cloud registration/cleaning/QA, BIM modeling in Revit at LoD 200/300/350/350+, 4 disciplines (Architecture, Structure, MEPF, Landscape). Deliverables: Revit model, colorized point cloud (.rcp), 360 photo documentation, sqft audit (BOMA Gross Area standards).
- BIM-to-CAD Conversion: Revit model converted to AutoCAD drawings per AIA or client-specific CAD standards.
- MEPF Modeling: Mechanical/electrical/plumbing/HVAC/fire safety visible components documented per LoD standard. LoD 350+ available.
- Landscape & Site Modeling: Topography/grounds/urban spaces in BIM/CAD. Georeferencing and forestry optional. Site plans at 1' or 5' contours. LoD 350+ for detailed foliage and heritage elements.
- Matterport 3D Tour: 360 photo walkthrough/dollhouse view/floor plans. Remote collaboration tool.
- Paper to BIM/CAD: Legacy 2D paper drawings converted to functional BIM or CAD. Customized for title blocks and drawing standards.
- Model Only / Point Cloud Only: Client provides one, S2P delivers the other.
- Facade Documentation: Terrestrial LiDAR captures facades up to ~20 stories from ground/roof. Solves NYC drone-restriction problem. BIM + CAD elevations for FISP/LL11 compliance.
- ArchiCAD Native Delivery: 25 projects completed, 4-5 active customers. Native authoring in ArchiCAD ("Native-Flex Specialist" positioning — not Revit-only, not just OpenBIM export).
- 360° Photo Documentation: High-resolution colorized imagery, platform by project.
- Structural Modeling: Beams, trusses, load-bearing elements. Applications: seismic retrofits, clash detection.
- UAV / Aerial Capture: Building exteriors, roof conditions, site topography. Part 107 certified. Photogrammetric and LiDAR-equipped options.
Supported Software
Revit (primary), AutoCAD, ArchiCAD, SketchUp, Rhino, Vectorworks, Solidworks, Chief Architect, Civil 3D, IFC, DWG/DXF
Turnaround
- Standard: 2-5 weeks from scan completion (scope-dependent)
- Typical phasing: Week 1 = point cloud + 3D tour + sqft audit; Week 2-3 = BIM model; Week 3-5 = QC + delivery
- Expedited: 20% fee, reduces by ~1 week
- On-site within 1 week of signed contract (50% deposit)
- Proposal within 24 hours of scoping conversation
- Field work duration: Small (<25K SF) 1-2 days; Medium (25-100K SF) 2-5 days; Large (100-500K SF) 1-2 weeks
Common Project Types (13 Defined)
Each has default disciplines, typical LoD, risk factors, proof attachment requirements:
(1) Residential renovation, (2) Commercial retrofit, (3) MEP retrofit, (4) Structural analysis, (5) Infrastructure/Transportation, (6) Historic Preservation, (7) Facade inspection (FISP/LL11/QEWI), (8) Adaptive reuse, (9) Hospitality, (10) Education, (11) Healthcare, (12) Religious, (13) Landscape
Workflow Options
- Scanning & Registration Only (point cloud only)
- Full Scan-to-BIM (complete scan & model)
- Modeling-Only (client-provided point cloud)
Geographic Coverage
Three-Tier Coverage Structure:
Tier
Scope
Minimum
Tier 1: Local
200-mile radius from NYC or Troy, NY
3,000 SF (scan-to-BIM) / 2 acres (landscape)
Tier 2: National
Anywhere in US

## 10,000 Sf
Tier 3: International
Global (selective)

## 10,000 Sf
Dual-Hub Regional Model:
- NYC Hub: Five boroughs, northern NJ, Long Island, Westchester, lower Hudson Valley, southwestern CT. Same-day service availability.
- Troy Hub: Capital Region (Albany/Schenectady/Troy), Adirondacks, Mohawk Valley, Finger Lakes, western NY (Syracuse/Rochester), Southern Tier, northern VT/NH.
- Overlap Zone: Hudson Valley, eastern NY, portions of CT/MA — either hub can serve. Provides schedule optimization and business continuity redundancy.
National/International:
Travel costs estimated at proposal, reconciled against actuals post-project with transparent documentation. National projects require multi-day mobilization with advance scheduling and firm site-readiness commitment. International requires equipment customs clearance, insurance verification, and advance logistics planning.
Project Minimums:
- Scan-to-BIM: 3,000 SF minimum (fixed overhead — mobilization, registration, QA — makes smaller projects uneconomical)
- Landscape: 2 acres minimum
- Border cases: Projects near thresholds evaluated case-by-case. Multi-building projects may aggregate SF across sites.

### 9.A — HBIM Characteristics (LoD 350+)
- Non-orthogonal geometry: Historic buildings rarely conform to modern orthogonal construction. HBIM captures irregularities rather than forcing orthogonal approximations.
- Custom family creation: Standard Revit families cannot represent historic molding profiles, ornamental metalwork, or period-specific features.
- Material documentation: Beyond geometry — documenting existing materials, conditions, deterioration patterns for conservation planning.
- Annotation integration: HBIM models integrate with HABS documentation standards and preservation-specific annotation requirements.
Common HBIM Applications:
- Secretary of Interior Standards compliance documentation
- Historic Tax Credit applications requiring measured drawings
- Adaptive reuse projects preserving character-defining features
- Cultural heritage digitization for archival purposes
- Grant compliance (NPS, SHPO, private foundation requirements)

### 9.B — Service Packages
Package
Description
Point Cloud Only
Validated, registered point cloud without BIM. Includes QA Packet with registration validation.
Model Only
Client provides point cloud; S2P creates BIM model. Quality assessment performed before modeling begins.
Scan + Model
Standard engagement: field capture, processing, modeling, delivery. Recommended for most projects.
Full Service + Coordination
Extended engagement including ongoing coordination support, model updates, and design team integration. For complex multi-phase projects or clients requiring embedded support.

### 9.C — Point Cloud Deliverable Tiers
- Production PC v2 (Archive): Full-density RCP/RCS in Project Coordinate System. Standard delivery within two weeks of scan completion. Archive master — enables re-processing without re-scanning. Recommended for projects >50,000 SF or when client anticipates future use beyond current scope. Maintained indefinitely.
- Client Point Cloud: Decimated and platform-optimized version of Production PC v2. Identical coordinate system. Delivered with BIM model. File format and density selected based on client software and workstation capabilities.
Both point clouds align perfectly with the model and are fully interchangeable.
File Delivery
Primary platform: Google Drive (password-protected, long-term accessibility, no expiration).
Supplementary platforms: Autodesk Construction Cloud (browser-based Revit/CAD viewing without licenses, markup/comments), Trimble TRCPS (browser-based point cloud viewing with measurement tools).
Delivery process: Pre-delivery file verification and organization → client notification with access instructions and deliverable inventory → 24-48 hour follow-up confirming access → security tier governs delivery method (Tier-1 cloud, Tier-2 restricted access, Tier-3 physical media with chain-of-custody).
