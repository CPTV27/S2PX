## 🎯 Section 6: Buyer Personas
7 personas mapped to S2P's current and aspirational ICP. Format standardized: Wants, Pain, Proof Needs, Decision Driver, Message. Each persona is a role, not a firm type — the same role behaves differently at a 15-person renovation firm vs a Top 50 enterprise, but the core drivers hold.

1. Executive / Principal (Decision Maker)
- Wants: Risk reduction, repeatable outcomes, standards-first language defensible to boards and partners
- Pain: Unpredictable vendor costs, quality variance across projects, liability exposure from undocumented deliverables
- Proof Needs: Certificate of Assurance, standards conformance documentation, portfolio case studies showing consistency across multiple projects
- Decision Driver: "Does this reduce my firm's risk exposure?"
- Message: As-Built Assurance — declared standards on every project. Pillar P3.
- ABM Note: Primary target for Tier-A outreach. At small firms, this person is also the Architect. At Top 50 firms, this is the office principal or practice leader who approves vendors.

2. CFO / Finance Decision Maker
- Wants: Predictable costs, transparent pricing methodology, defensible vendor selection for audit trail
- Pain: Hidden change orders, vendors who can't explain their pricing, inability to compare bids on equal terms
- Proof Needs: Pricing philosophy documentation, scope/CO trigger framework, GM discipline evidence, multi-project rate card examples
- Decision Driver: "Can I predict and defend this cost?"
- Message: Transparent pricing built on declared scope — sqft-audited, CO-triggered, no surprises. Pillar P2.
- ABM Note: Secondary contact in Tier-A vendor approval pathway. Rarely the first touch — reached after Principal engagement confirms interest.

3. Architect / Designer (Core Buyer — 85%+ of Current Revenue)
- Wants: Design control, legible deliverables that don't require rework, proof of LoD 200/300/350 standards matched to project needs
- Pain: Documentation burden stealing design time, unreliable vendors delivering inconsistent quality, receiving models that need extensive cleanup before use
- Proof Needs: Proof Vault samples at matching LoD and building type, testimonials from peer architects, QA Packet examples
- Decision Driver: "Will this model let me start designing immediately?"
- Message: Focus on Design — remove the documentation drag. Pillar P1.
- ABM Note: At current ICP firms, this person is often also the Principal. At Tier-A firms, this is the project architect or design lead — the internal champion who validates technical capability before the Principal approves.

4. Project Manager
- Wants: On-time handoffs, scope lock, predictable outputs with no surprises, clear communication protocol
- Pain: Scope creep, vendor communication gaps, deliverable format mismatches, missed deadlines with no escalation path
- Proof Needs: Timeline adherence records, clear SOW with CO triggers, defined revision policy, named points of contact per project phase
- Decision Driver: "Will this vendor hit deadlines and stay in scope?"
- Message: Ready When You Are — mobilization SLA, delivery timeline, and defined escalation. Pillar P5.
- ABM Note: Key operational contact once deal progresses. At Tier-A firms, the PM often controls vendor scheduling and can accelerate or stall engagement.

5. Engineer — Structural
- Wants: Defensible dimensional data with declared tolerances, LoA clarity, point cloud as validation tool for structural assessment
- Pain: Field measurement errors requiring multiple site visits, inability to verify hidden conditions, receiving models that can't support load calculations
- Proof Needs: LoA documentation with registration reports, structural point cloud use cases, tolerance methodology explanation
- Decision Driver: "Can I trust this data for my calculations?"
- Message: Certainty Lies in Good Data — declared LoA with validation evidence. Pillar P2.
- ABM Note: Structural engineers are specifiers, not typically first-touch targets. They influence scope (LoD/LoA requirements, discipline add-ons) and validate technical credibility. Reach through Architect or PM referral.

6. Engineer — MEP / Sustainability
- Wants: Accurate MEP routing documentation, LoD 300 MEPF models with sizing thresholds declared, data usable for energy modeling and decarbonization compliance
- Pain: Undocumented MEP conditions forcing field verification, silent voids in ceiling spaces, models that omit systems below arbitrary sizing cutoffs without disclosure
- Proof Needs: MEP sizing threshold documentation, MEPF LoD 300 Proof Vault samples, compliance-trigger use cases (LL97/BERDO/BEUDO baselining)
- Decision Driver: "Will this capture what I need for engineering analysis and compliance documentation?"
- Message: MEPF-accurate as-builts with declared sizing thresholds and no silent voids. Pillar P2 + P3.
- ABM Note: Growing persona — MEPF LoD 300 tripled to 6.3% of revenue in FY2025. Compliance-trigger outreach (P9) targets this persona directly. Decarbonization mandates are creating new demand from MEP engineers who previously had no scan-to-BIM budget.

7. Procurement / Vendor Approval
- Wants: Clarity and comparability across vendor proposals, deliverable specification tables, security documentation, insurance certificates
- Pain: Vendor vagueness making apples-to-apples comparison impossible, no standard framework for evaluating scan-to-BIM quality claims
- Proof Needs: LoD/LoA spec sheets, security documentation (Tier 1/2/3 per project sensitivity), insurance certificates, Price-Match Challenge form as evaluation framework
- Decision Driver: "Can I evaluate this vendor against others using clear, defensible criteria?"
- Message: Declared LoD + LoA, transparent pricing, standards-based deliverables. The Price-Match Challenge form is the evaluation tool. Pillar P3.
- ABM Note: Gatekeeper, not initiator. Procurement receives a vendor-ready cover packet (P8), not a marketing beat. Engagement happens after Principal or Architect has expressed interest. S2P's Vendor-Ready Packet and security tier framework are designed to compress this gate.

Persona Prioritization (FY2026)
Tier-A ABM targets: Executive/Principal persona at Top 50 firms, with CFO and Procurement as secondary contacts for vendor approval pathway. Architect/Designer persona serves as internal champion and technical validator.
Current revenue base: Architect/Designer persona at small-to-midsize renovation firms, typically also the Principal. This person makes decisions fast (11-day median close) and doesn't involve Procurement.
Content implication: All external materials must serve both audiences simultaneously. Current ICP needs simplicity, speed, and trust signals. Tier-A needs standards credibility, proof at scale, and vendor-readiness signals.

Dropped Personas (Rationale)
- GC / MEP Trade Partner: S2P's revenue is 85%+ from design professionals. GCs are occasional buyers, not a strategic persona for FY2026 ABM.
- Facilities Manager: Post-occupancy data needs (COBie, FM handover) are real but represent a future service extension, not current demand.
- BIM Manager: At current ICP firms, the BIM Manager doesn't exist as a separate role. At Tier-A firms, BIM Manager concerns (template adoption, ISO 19650 alignment) are addressed through Architect and PM personas during project onboarding, not during sales.
