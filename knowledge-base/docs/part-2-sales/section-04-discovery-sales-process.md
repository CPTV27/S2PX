## 🔍 Section 4: Discovery & Sales Process
Current Sales Flow
Top of Funnel (Matt/Amplifi): Cold outreach, LinkedIn/social media, contact enrichment, CRM management, multi-touch persona-specific email sequences to Firm Principals and CFOs. Tools: MoFu Concierge AI, Copy Engine AI. Goal: book qualified meetings for Owen. Does not close deals or run discovery calls.
Mid-Funnel (Owen): Discovery call unscripted, sector-adaptive. Identifies sector needs, focuses on whichever value prop resonates. References Client Guide concepts and LoD/LoA definitions. Walks through comparable project for pricing context.
Bottom of Funnel (Owen): Proposal generated in PandaDoc (migrating to S2POS). Turnaround: proposal within 24 hours of scoping conversation. Signature via PandaDoc e-signature.
Post-Close (Kurt): Kurt takes over as client point-of-contact. Scheduling, logistics, field tech assignment. BIM kickoff call for Tier-A projects (Kurt + Drayton; covers coordinates, templates, standards). Stage coordination: Scanning → Registration → Modeling → QC (4-pass per Section 8.A) → Delivery. Revisions handled through Kurt/Megumi/Drayton depending on type.
Deal Structure Reality
- Many proposals bundled inside architect's proposal to building owner (architect may be 1 of 7 firms proposing)
- When S2P specifically loses: usually price or solution gaps (360 photos)
- Deals often fall apart for reasons unrelated to S2P's bid
- No systematic loss-reason tracking exists
- Sales cycle metrics, conversion rates, and deal size tiers → Section 3

### 4.A — Funnel Stage Dictionary
Stages: Lead → Engaged → Meeting → Opportunity → Proposal → Closed (Won/Lost)
Gatekeeper Rules:
- No Opportunity without a qualified Meeting logged and categorized
- No Proposal without a completed Scope Audit and estimated margin view
- No stage advancement without Source + Assist attribution populated
- No late-funnel follow-up without proof discipline satisfied ("1 link + 1 proof")
- Stall threshold: 14 days without meaningful movement
Scope Audit (Pre-Proposal — Required): Size band, scope boundary, disciplines, level-of-detail, travel handling, risk flags, expedite flag, change-order triggers.
GM Discipline: GM Glance (advisory, pre-proposal) → GM Gate (enforced, proposals below 40% require named override + logged reason). Detail in Section 3.

### 4.B — Attribution Schema
- Source (single): ABM, CEU, Referral/Partner, Proof Vault, Spec/Standards, Podcast, Permit Trigger (P9), Other
- Assist (multi): Additional influences on deal
- Campaign or wave identifier when applicable
- Win/Loss reason taxonomy required on every Closed-Lost
- No-meeting reason codes: Wrong persona, timing, proof mismatch, procurement friction, pricing resistance
- Attribution completeness target: ≥98% of opportunities; 100% of closed-lost have win/loss notes

### 4.C — Vendor-Ready Packet
Packet v1 Contents: W-9, COI/insurance certificate(s), ACH/bank letter + remittance, EIN/formation proof, safety statement, security statement, contact list (Sales, PM/Delivery, Finance/AP), one-page Standards & QA sheet.
Portal Completion Kit: Copy-paste profile fields, attachment index, known-systems notes.
Internal SLA: Legal/procurement edits 48-hour turnaround; finance/AP same-day; every blocker has named owner + next action date.
Targets: ≥3 approved vendor lists; median yes→PO ≤21 days; ≥2 departments added inside one approved firm; procurement never the reason a deal misses start date.
Escalation: Any "yes" with no PO by day 21 → escalation. Portal invite not received within 3 business days → re-request.
