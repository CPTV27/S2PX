## 👣 Section 5: Client Journey & Project Execution
The end-to-end client experience from first contact through post-delivery support. This section describes what the client lives through — not internal operations (Sections 7-8), deliverable specs (Section 9), or sales mechanics (Section 4).

10-Step Client Journey
Step
What Happens
Key Output
1. Initial Consultation
Understand client needs, scope, and deliverables (15-30 min, no commitment)
Requirements clarity
2. Scope Definition & Proposal
Confirm LoD, disciplines, deliverables, platform, and pricing. Delivered within 24-48 hours
Written proposal
3. Contract & Deposit
Client signs contract, pays 50% deposit
Scheduling guaranteed
4. Pre-Scan Site Survey
Digital site review (Google Earth, Zillow, site plans, client-supplied docs)
Access plan, scan strategy
5. Kickoff Call
Align all stakeholders on scope, schedule, access, and point of contact
Team alignment
6. On-Site Scanning
Field team captures point clouds and 360 photos
Raw scan data
7. Point Cloud Registration
Scans aligned, validated, and audited (sqft verification via BOMA Gross Area)
Registered point cloud
8. BIM/CAD Production
Point cloud converted to BIM/CAD models per contracted LoD
Model deliverables
9. Quality Control & QA
Multi-stage QC process; QA Packet assembled with validation evidence
QC-verified deliverables
10. Client Review & Delivery
Final files delivered; client reviews and requests revisions as needed
Accepted deliverables

Pre-Scan Workflow
Before any scanning, Scan2Plan conducts four preparation activities:
1. Digital Site Survey. Google Earth, Zillow, and any client-supplied documentation (floor plans, site photos, prior surveys) are used to evaluate site access, entrances, parking, and scanning areas. Existing drawings help orient field work and validate coverage — helpful but not required.
2. Client Alignment & Scope Confirmation. Exact scan areas confirmed (interior-only, exterior-only, partial). Site access, security clearances, and escort requirements verified. Scope (LoD, LoA, deliverables, platform) re-confirmed before contract finalization.
3. Scheduling & Travel Logistics. Site visits scheduled via Airtable job tracking. Scan technicians assigned, travel logistics planned, lodging arranged if applicable. Typical mobilization: 1 week from contract approval.
4. Pre-Scan Equipment Check. Scanner calibration verified (Trimble X7, NavVis VLX2). PPE compliance confirmed (hard hats, safety vests, steel-toe boots, respirators, gloves as required).

What Happens On Site
Scanning is quiet and non-disruptive. The Trimble X7 emits an invisible laser and captures a full-dome scan in 3-4 minutes per position. Technicians move through the space methodically, typically spacing positions 20-25 feet apart to achieve 65-70% overlap between scans.
Scale reference: A typical 50,000 SF building requires 60-100 scan positions. Occupied buildings can be scanned during normal operations. Active construction sites require appropriate PPE and safety coordination.
White Glove Protocol: Technicians do not touch, move, or interact with client property unless explicitly required and pre-approved.
On-site review: Before leaving, technicians review captured scans to confirm all contracted areas have been covered. Field registration is validated on-site (Trimble X7 advantage — real-time cloud-to-cloud verification).

What We Need From You
Requirement
Why It Matters
Site Access
Coordinated access to all areas within scope. Locked rooms, occupied spaces, and access restrictions must be documented before field work. Inaccessible areas = coverage gaps = assumptions in the model.
Ceiling Access
If above-ceiling MEP is in scope, coordinate ceiling tile removal or ladder access. Above-ceiling work typically requires 2-4x the field time of standard floor scanning.
Existing Documentation
Available floor plans, CAD files, or prior surveys help orient field work and validate coverage. Not required, but helpful.
Technical Requirements
Target platform (Revit version, etc.), coordinate system preferences, any template or family standards to follow.
Point of Contact
Single decision-maker for scope questions and approvals during execution.

Information
Why It Matters
Building Address
Determines travel/mobilization and service tier
Approximate Square Footage
Primary driver of field and modeling effort
Building Type
Office, industrial, healthcare, historic — affects complexity and pricing
Scope (Int/Ext/Both)
Interior-only and exterior-only scoping affects pricing
Disciplines Required
Architectural, Structural, MEP, or combination
Intended Use
Determines appropriate LoD/LoA specification
Timeline
When deliverables are needed; expedited available (see Section 9)
Delivery Platform
Revit version, ArchiCAD, AutoCAD, etc.

Revision Policy
Unlimited revisions within contracted scope. No extra fees. Applies to all deliverable types (BIM, CAD, point cloud, PDF).
Included in unlimited revisions:
- Corrections to existing elements (walls, doors, windows, beams) where errors are found
- File format changes (e.g., DWG instead of DXF)
- Template adjustments (title blocks, layer naming, Revit family names)
- Refinements based on client design review feedback
Requires change order:
- Adding areas not in original scope
- Adding disciplines (e.g., MEPF after architecture-only contract)
- Upgrading LoD (e.g., 300 to 350+)
- Re-scanning changed conditions
Revision turnaround:
- Small (wall alignment, template update): 1-3 business days
- Large (floor rework, LoD upgrade within scope): 1-2 weeks
- File format conversion: 1 business day
How to request: Email assigned Project Manager with specific request. Acknowledgment within 24 hours. Estimated timeline provided at acknowledgment. Changes verified by QC before re-delivery.

Post-Delivery Support
Support does not expire. No additional charge for scope-related questions. (See Section 1: Lifetime Support guarantee.)
What's included:
- File re-access (re-download from Google Drive or platform links)
- Technical guidance (importing point clouds into Revit, file format compatibility, measurement tools in Trimble ScanExplorer)
- Corrections within contracted LoD/LoA
- Coordinate system clarification
- File format re-export
File retention: Indefinite. Google Drive and tape backup. No time limits, no storage fees. Clients who lose access can request file re-share — typically fulfilled within 1-3 business days.
How to request support: Email Project Manager or info@scan2plan.io. Acknowledgment within 24 hours. Small support requests resolved in 1-3 business days. Revision requests follow turnaround schedule above.
