# PART III: TECHNOLOGY, STANDARDS & DELIVERY

## Technology Stack

- **Scanning Equipment:** Trimble X7 (primary terrestrial LiDAR) and NavVis VLX2 (Tier-A large-scale via BuildScan 3D vendor).
- **Registration Software:** Trimble RealWorks, Autodesk ReCap Pro, CloudCompare.
- **Modeling Software:** Revit (Primary), AutoCAD, ArchiCAD ("Native-Flex Specialist" positioning).

## The 12-Point Assurance Standard

Every deliverable explicitly addresses these 12 points to create a defensible benchmark:

| # | Standard | Requirement |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 1 | Deliverables Listed | Specific formats and file types explicitly enumerated. |
| 2 | LoD Stated | Stated per discipline (e.g., Architecture LoD 300). |
| 3 | Cloud LoA Stated | LoA-40 per USIBD v3.1 or stated alternative. |
| 4 | Model LoA Stated | LoA-30 per USIBD v3.1 or stated alternative. |
| 5 | Coordinate Basis | Project-local with origin, or CRS with EPSG code. |
| 6 | Level Datum | Stated reference for what elevation = 0'-0". |
| 7 | Control Documented | Survey control points/accuracy, or statement of "no control". |
| 8 | Registration Metrics | RMS residuals, overlap percentages, and scan count. |
| 9 | Coverage Limits | Areas scanned, excluded, or inaccessible stated with maps. |
| 10 | Assumptions Logged | Interpretations made where data was obstructed. |
| 11 | Acceptance Defined | Measurable criteria for a "pass". |
| 12 | Support Scope | Defined inclusions, change order rules, and timelines. |

## BIM QC Workflow -- 4-Pass Process

Dual sign-off is required before delivery proceeds. The Pass 2 reviewer is never the same person who created the model.

| Pass | Operator | Focus |
|------|----------|-------|
| 1 | Modeler | Self-QC on element placement and LoD spec completeness. |
| 2 | Peer Reviewer | Fresh-Eyes QC for point cloud overlay verification and accuracy. |
| 3 | Drayton (QC Lead) | Technical QC on model structure, coordinates, and worksets. |
| 4 | Megumi (Studio Manager) | Scope verification, QA packet, and platform load testing. |
