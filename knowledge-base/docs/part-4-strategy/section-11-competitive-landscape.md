## 🏁 Section 11: Competitive Landscape
Market Position Summary
S2P operates in the Scan-to-BIM services market: pure-play scan-to-BIM firms, surveying companies with BIM capabilities, large AEC consultancies offering scanning as add-on, and offshore modeling shops. Over 100 direct competitors.
131-Competitor Statistical Analysis
Source: S2P_Competitor_Landscape_REBUILD_v7 (131 US firms, 4 tiers).
Tagline Lexicon:
Most-used words: BIM (74), scanning (52), laser (42), capture (33), Revit (16). Almost no verbs or outcomes — competitors sell nouns, not results.
Standards Silence:
~2.3% explicitly reference LoD/LoA/USIBD in front-facing copy. Fear of accountability.
Guarantees Nearly Nonexistent:
~0.8% hint at guarantee/SLA/price-match. Risk completely unaddressed.
Sustainability/Adaptive Reuse:
~4-5% mention it. Untapped narrative.
Theme Frequency:
- Integration/workflow: ≈67% (dominant)
- Tech buzz: ≈62%
- Accuracy/precision: ≈40%
- Risk/quality: ≈15%
- Speed/turnaround: ≈5%
Channels/Content:
- Primary: LinkedIn + website
- Case/portfolio: ~56%
- Blog/articles: ~11%
- Video: ~4%
- Webinars/events: ~3%
- Whitepaper/guide: ~1.5%
- Education is a white space.
Common Gaps:
Few named case studies, limited public LoD/LoA detail, thin thought leadership, scanning buried inside larger AEC practices.
Market Tells
- Competitors sell nouns, not outcomes. Out-position with risk transfer + design time saved.
- Almost no LoD/LoA in public = fear of accountability. Publish standards and win trust.
- Risk unaddressed. As-Built Assurance is wide open to own.
- Sustainability untapped. Tie scanning to adaptive reuse/carbon.
- Procurement language missing. No vendor-onboarding or portfolio standardization talk.
- Education vacuum. Thought leadership → pipeline for the taking.
- Visual proof underused. Viewer + QA packet front and center is novel.
- "Nationwide" is their default flex. Counter with SLA'd mobilization + guaranteed outcomes.
Competitive Spectrum
- Revit-Only Shops: Majority of market
- OpenBIM Exporters: Revit-authored, exported to IFC/DWG
- Native-Flex Specialists: S2P's position — native authoring in client's platform of choice
Actual Differentiators vs. Table-Stakes
Defensible Differentiators:
- LoD + LoA dual-standard declaration on every project
- 12-Point Assurance Standard with Certificate
- Sqft audit pricing model (BOMA method — transparent, auditable)
- 7.5-year production team relationship (consistency across 1,000+ projects)
- Hybrid LoD scoping (350 where it matters, 200 elsewhere)
- Client template/standards adoption (design-ready on delivery)
- ArchiCAD native capability (25 projects — rare in market)
- Principal-level engagement on every project
- Spec-first competitive moat (pre-written LoD/LoA acceptance language for client RFPs)
Table-Stakes (Must Retire or Reframe):
- "High-Quality Data for Superior Results" — universal claim
- "Rigorous Quality Control" — generic
- "Customized to Your Standards" — expected
- "Experienced, dedicated team" — baseline
- "100% manual approach" — reframe as "every model built and verified by human experts"
Competitive Counter-Moves by Archetype
- Nationwide Scanners (PPM/GPRS/Arrival): Lead with Guarantee + QA packet + price-match at equal spec. Reframe "nationwide" as consistency risk without standards.
- Big AEC Divisions (AECOM/Stantec/Gensler): Position specialist focus + spec-first program; offer to standardize vendors under S2P acceptance criteria.
- Legacy Pioneers (Direct Dimensions/Existing Conditions): Counter "experience" with contractual outcomes + viewer-led proof.
- Low-Cost Boutiques: Disarm with price-match at equal spec and risk-cost story (change orders vs. fee).
White-Space Plays
- Category carve-out: As-Built Assurance — "Guaranteed certainty, from capture to coordination."
- Contractual confidence: Public Guarantee Sheet (accuracy/LoA, deadlines, price-match at equal spec)
- Standards leadership: Visible LoD/LoA declaration on every proposal + mini QA report sample
- Design Freedom narrative: "We guarantee the canvas so you can design."
- BIM without blame: "Clash-checked, tolerance-verified, zero RFI fuel."
- Portfolio standardization: "One vendor, one standard, guaranteed."
- Spec-first motion: Living Div 01/02 clause + free spec audit. Force competitors onto S2P's field.
- Adaptive-reuse positioning: "The greenest building is the one already built."
- Viewer-first late funnel: Every follow-up includes guided viewer tour + QA excerpt.
- Education engine: AIA-HSW CEU + workshops + Masterclass articles.

## Swot
- Strengths: Published LoA/LoD; accuracy & turnaround guarantees; 1-week mobilization / 2-5 week modeling; client-template delivery; HBIM expertise; transparent TKB; unlimited in-scope revisions; 7.5-year production team.
- Weaknesses: Newer brand vs. incumbents with 10K+ buildings; regional hubs (Troy/NYC core); smaller public case library (growing); key-person dependency (Owen sole closer); 2022-vintage website.
- Opportunities: Thought-leadership vacuum (CEUs, guides, webinars); "Design Freedom" narrative; portfolio standardization for enterprise; sustainability/adaptive-reuse story; partner co-marketing; spec-first competitive moat; education white space.
- Threats: Commoditization/price pressure ("scanner-in-a-van" bids); in-house capture (GCs/megafirms buying scanners); AI-assisted modeling automation; big-firm bundling (integrated AEC cross-sell); macro construction cycles; renovation slowdowns.
