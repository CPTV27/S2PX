## Section 10: Fy2026 Strategy
Objectives
- O1 — Double Revenue to $2.2M, Defend Margin: Revenue mix 60%+ from projects 50K+ sqft; ASP +50% vs FY25; GM 40% commit / 45% stretch; 12+ projects at 50K+ sqft; 2+ multi-site/program pilots; 4.5 qualified meetings/week Tier-A weighted.
- O2 — Become Region's Educational Standard-Bearer: 20-22 CEU sessions; Host-to-Meeting conversion 30%+; Proof Vault 400-450 uses; Viewer-to-Meeting 20-23%; Spec Starter 15+ citations in active pursuits; Newsletter CTR 3%+ to consult/CEU/spec pages.
- O3 — Land & Expand Tier-A Accounts: 60+ Tier-A meetings; 4+ pilots at 50K+ sqft, 2+ progress to program status; 3+ megafirm vendor approvals; Vendor-ready packet complete; Reply-to-meeting 18%+ on Tier-A outreach.
Fixed Portfolio P1-P22
Portfolio is locked. New projects require replacement of an existing project and CEO sign-off.

Year Arc
- Q1 (Jan-Mar) BUILD: Security/QA packet, vendor apps submitted, Proof Mailer v1 to A-25 list, 12-15 meetings. P10/P11 launch March. Proof Vault build completes Q1 scope.
- Q2 (Apr-Jun) LAUNCH: Website P21 + ABM P5/P6 go live. Two pilots live. Wave 2. Referral pod. 1-2 vendor approvals.
- THE HINGE: May (Website + Vendor Onboarding) and June (ABM Waves + Proof Mailer) are staggered payload moments that define the year.
- Q3 (Jul-Sep) SCALE: Wave 3, expand pilots, 1-2 more approvals, first program award. P3 CEU launches July. P22 Process Shorts launches August.
- Q4 (Oct-Dec) COMPOUND: Wave 4, program expansions, multi-site rollouts, renewals.
Q1 Exit Criteria (Must Be True by March 31)
If not true, May and June become noise without conversion:
- Proof exists and is usable: Vault populated, structured, mapped to buyer objections
- Standards are published: P11 Spec & Standards + P10 Spec Starter live
- Discipline is enforced: Funnel rules and GM gates as default behavior
Mega Whales ABM Target List
Top 50 US architecture firms by 2024 revenue (Architectural Record 2025). Rank 1: Gensler ($1.86B, 56 offices) through Rank 50: Woolpert ($89M, 43 offices). Office-level data mapped with city, region, URL, primary discipline, focus tags (17 categories).
Trigger Pods (Automated Lead Gen)
- Permit Pod (P9, May): NYC DOB permits, Boston/Cambridge permits. 48-hour SLA from trigger to outreach. Ramp 0→30→60→100%.
- Compliance Pod (P16, Sep): NYC LL11/FISP, LL87, LL97, Boston BERDO/BEUDO.
- Procurement Pod (P17, Oct): RFP/RFQ monitoring via DASNY, NYSCR, PASSPort, Boston bids.
- All pods: enrichment playbook ≤12 min/trigger, SSOT data model.
Portfolio Standardization Program (P15)
For multi-building/campus clients:
- Master Program SOW (3 lanes: Pilot/Rollout/Refresh + CO triggers)
- Pricing framework v1.0 (bands + add-ons + floors + small-job minimums)
- Ops playbook v1.0 (intake to delivery, roles, QA/acceptance)
- Proof kit (program-ready selections + assurance one-pager)
- Optional financial module (credits/subscription) only after controls prove out
- Target: 1-2 pilots using pack conversion path to rollout
Practice Forward Podcast (Dormant Asset)
33 episodes with architecture firm principals. Dormant — zero conversion to billable work was reason for pause. Single strongest proof of podcast-to-pipeline pathway: Arrowstreet (David Bois, Partner) progressed from podcast guest to active Tier-A delivery relationship (Logan Central Parking, multiple large invoices). Reactivation potential feeds P13 Podcast-to-Pipeline.
Strategic Risks
- Launch overload kills GM and throughput — cap ≤2 major launches per month
- Scope creep erodes margin — enforce SOW/CO guardrails, GM gate before proposals
- Procurement drag — complete security packet, named custodians, Legal on 48-hour SLA
- Persona drift — freeze A-25 list weekly, replace outliers quickly
- Proof fatigue — rotate kits quarterly, refresh case briefs via repurposing
Hockey Stick Model — Monthly KPI Projections
Core Assumptions:
Variable
Value
FY25 Baseline
~$1.0M bookings, ~35-38% GM, ~8 projects/month, ~8 scan-days/month
FY26 Target
$2.2M bookings; GM 40% commit / 45% stretch
Seasonality
Camel hump: slow Dec-Jan and Jul-Aug; peaks Mar-May; secondary lift Sep
Lag effect
Major launches show impact 1-2 quarters later
Growth by quarter
Q1-Q2 build ($950K), Q3 peak ($830K), Q4 sustain (~$450K)
GM ramp
~35% → 45% across the year
Conversion heuristics
~6 leads → 1 deal; ~3 proposals → 1 deal
Cash lag
Cash lags bookings by ~3 months (4 weeks to start + net-60)

### 10.B — ABM Wave Operating System (P6)
Wave Structure: 4 waves (W1-W4) across the year. Build windows and no-major-launch months respected. Cohort definitions: A-25, A-40, "deepen winners," "reactivate engaged," plus exclusion rules. A-25 → A-40 expansion gating: no scaling until KPI bars hold for 4 consecutive weeks.
Persona Beats Library (Locked to 3):
- Standards/acceptance — LoD/LoA transparency + acceptance criteria
- Program speed — mobilization SLA + delivery timeline + portfolio scale
- Zero-RFI / risk-reduction pilot — clash-checked models + tolerance reports
- Procurement gets a separate vendor-ready cover, not a fourth beat
Proof Mapping Rule: Every follow-up includes one link + one proof (from P4 Proof Vault). No case study dumps.
Multi-Threading Rule: No single-threading inside Tier-A. Minimum roles per account with required contact completeness.
Orchestration: Touch window ~10-12 days then stop and move to nurture. Signal response SLA: replies/scans/views trigger fast follow-up.
Kill/Keep Discipline: Weekly review. Retire low-signal segments. No net-new tactics until conversion clears thresholds. No adding channels/beats during a wave — changes only at retro.
Per-Wave Targets: ≥30 qualified meetings per wave (≥12 Tier-A); time-to-meeting ≤12 days median.
Wave Completion Definition: Cohort frozen and executed to completion, weekly kill/keep ran every week, retro published, KPI bars hit or diagnosis documented, winners codified, process repeatable by someone other than CEO.

### 10.C — ABM Proof Mailer (P5)
Kit Contents (v1): A5 mini-casebook (vertical-matched), QA packet excerpt, viewer QR code, Standards one-pager (Guarantee Sheet), meeting CTA: "20-min Assurance Review."
Gatekeeper Rules: No launch until proof tracked (P4), pricing/SOW standards exist (P1), stage discipline enforceable (P2). No scaling spend unless cohort performance clears thresholds. No expanding A-25 → A-40 until v1 holds for 4 consecutive weeks.
Sequencing: P21 launches start of Q2, P5 one month later, P6 does not go wide until P5 v1 performance holds 4 weeks.

### 10.D — Permit Trigger Pod (P9)
Intake Streams: Stream A (daily): permit filings. Stream B (weekly): permit approvals. Stream C (optional v1.1+): RFx/planholder signals.
Qualification Gates: Pass 1 (Fast): geo gate (NY/NE), scope gate (renovation/adaptive reuse/retrofit/TI/preservation/facade/MEP/campus), exclusion gate (ground-up-only, signage-only, etc.). Pass 2 (Definitive): size band confirmation, building type classification.
Tier Routing: Tier-A ≥50K SF → always pursue. Tier-B 10-50K SF → pursue if renovation keywords. Tier-C 3-10K SF → pursue only with strong program/institutional signal.
Contact Discovery SOP: Timeboxed ≤12 minutes. Firm website → call main line → log contact form. Record confidence flag.
Outreach Kit: One sentence referencing signal, one sentence standards hook, one proof link (2-3 matched examples), single meeting CTA (15 min).
Follow-Up: Touch 1 within 48h (≤24h Tier-A); Touch 2 at 2-3 days; Touch 3 at 7-10 days; stop at 14 days → slow nurture. If link viewed: reply within 2 hours.
SLA Breach: Must produce breach lists at any time. If SLA breaches >10% in a week, throttle intake.

### 10.E — Referral/Partner Program (P7)
Structure: Perpetual invoice credits (not cash) rewarding qualified, in-geo, repeatable work without breaking margin.
Fit Gate: Geo: NY, MA, NJ, VT, CT, NH, ME. Work: renovation/adaptive reuse, ≥3K sqft or ≥$3K, recurring potential. Exclude: new-construction-only, micro one-offs, no decision path.
Attribution Gate: Partner is primary source for any deal within 12 months. Multi-touch rule: partner remains primary even if ABM also touched.
Margin Gate: Credits apply only if post-credit GM ≥ floor. Redemption capped per invoice; excess rolls forward.
Quality Gate: Two low-fit intros in a quarter → pause credit accrual. No exclusivity.
90-Day Targets: 5 partners onboarded; ≥10 qualified intros; ≥5 booked meetings; ≥2 qualified opps; intro→meeting median ≤45 days.
6-12 Month Targets: Partner-sourced pipeline ≥$300K; ≥80% of intros pass fit gate; ≤1 pause event per quarter.

### 10.F — Seasonal Capacity Planning
Compressed Months (Dec, Jan, Jul, Aug): Shift to tightening engines, refining offers, executing already-built payloads. Internal scan capacity: 20 scan-days/month (Dec, Jul, Aug).
Expanded Months (Feb-May, Sep-Nov): Concentrate Tier-A meetings, proposals, close discipline. Internal scan capacity: 40 scan-days/month (full months), 30 in Nov.
No-Launch Months: January, February, April (build/integrate). July, August (short-month tightening). November, December (execute and close only).

### 10.G — P10-P22 Project Specs
P10 — Spec Starter Kit (March): 3-5 page Spec Insert Pack (DOCX + PDF) with paste-ready RFP language. Three MasterFormat-aligned clause inserts: 01 33 00 (Submittals), 01 78 39 (Project Record Docs), 02 21 13 (Existing Conditions). Variable Registry with bracketed fields. Targets: ≥60% of active pursuits within 90 days; redlines down ≥20%; first-pass acceptance ≥95%.
P11 — Standards Hub (March): Four canonical web pages: LoD, LoA, Verification + Acceptance, Exchange + Coordinate Policy. Semantic versioning. Quarterly review cycle. All downstream docs reference version number.
P14 — Assurance Sheet & QA Packet (Active): Assurance Sheet (1 page) generated from quoting record. No proposal is "final" unless Assurance Sheet attached and approved. QA Packet (≤15 pages): capture log, registration report, spot-checks (5 per 10K SF per discipline, min 15/project), file audit, NCR log, sign-offs. 5 business day acceptance window; three outcomes (Accepted / Rejected-defects / Rejected-scope).
P15 — Portfolio Standardization (October): Program Pack (scope standards, file/folder rules, coordinate rules, QA/acceptance, data handling). Master SOW with 3 lanes (Pilot/Rollout/Refresh). Size-band pricing. Completion: ≥1 client adopts; ≥1 pilot converts or ≥$400K pipeline.
P16 — Compliance Trigger Pod (September): NYC LL11/FISP, LL87, LL97; Boston BERDO/BEUDO. Three outreach families (facade baseline, MEPF audit, retrofit BIM). Targets: ≥8 meetings/quarter; SLA ≤48h.
P17 — Procurement Trigger Pod (October): Sources: DASNY, NYSCR, PASSPort, Boston bids. Event-driven page-change monitoring + weekly sweep backstop. Firm normalization and dedup before outreach. Targets: ≥6-10 meetings/quarter; ≥50 net-new firms/quarter.
P18 — Repurposing Automation (August): Standard outputs per event: 6+ short clips, 1 case brief, 1 article, 1 Vault tile, 3 SDR follow-up inserts. Mandatory metadata on every asset. Targets: median hero asset age ≤45 days; yield within 7-10 days; Vault usage ≥90% of late-funnel follow-ups.
P19 — Custom Deck Blueprints (July): 10 locked blueprints, 8-10 slides each. Universal spine: Problem → Acceptance/QA → Scope → Speed → Pricing → Proof → Case → Assurance → Next steps. v1 covers 10 verticals. Targets: assembly ≤30 min; ≥90% adoption.
P20 — "The Castle" (February, complete): Canonical side-by-side proof of LoD 200/300/350 across Architecture/Structural/MEPF on same building zones. 3-5 zones × 3 LoDs × 3 disciplines = 27-45 tiles. Each tile: 3D viewer link + PDF sheet sample + CAD sample + Spec-Match sheet.
P21 — Site/CRO Rebuild (April): Four actions: Book CEU, View Proof, Get Spec, Book Meeting. Five high-velocity pages: CEU, Spec & Standards Library, Proof Hub (NDA gate), Procurement, Program Offer. Performance: LCP ≤2.0s, TTFB ≤0.8s; CEU signup ≥3.5%; Spec download ≥4%; Proof hub CTR ≥6%; Booking ≥8%.
P22 — Process Shorts (August): 12 locked micro-proofs, 60-90s each. Six accuracy/QA, three speed/coverage, two security/procurement, one program. Script template: Hook → Proof moment → Callouts → CTA. Targets: QV→Meeting ≥6-8%; Short→Proof CTR ≥10%.
