## 💰 Section 3: Financial Profile, Pricing & Market Position
All financial data is QuickBooks-verified (net of discounts, deposit credits, bundle adjustments). Revenue figures reflect project-level deduplication: ~54% of projects generate two invoices (50% deposit + final payment), so invoice counts overstate project counts.

Revenue grew 75% from 2021 to 2025. Growth is driven by larger projects (APV +81%), not more projects — project count has been flat at ~100/year since 2021. FY2026 annualized pace is $1.48M, below the $2.2M target. Requires Q2-Q4 acceleration per FY2026 operating model.
Note: QB-verified revenue covers 2021-2026 (~500 invoiced projects). The S2POS Migration Manifest tracks 632 projects including pre-QB and non-invoiced work. An additional 400+ Matterport scanning projects from 2018-2020 predate the current business but represent foundational field experience.


### 3.2 Deal Size Distribution

FY2025 Share
Trend
Micro (<$2.5K)

Dying — was 5.6% in 2021. Correct; unprofitable at scale.
Minnow ($2.5-10K)
$2,500-$10,000
28.1%
Shrinking — was 48% in 2021. Most Minnows churn; they don't become Dolphins.
Dolphin ($10-50K)
$10,000-$50,000
54.1%
Core engine — stable at 42-54%. 72% of 2026 YTD.
Whale ($50K+)
$50,000+
16.5%
Episodic — 5 Whale projects all-time. Appeared in 2022, disappeared 2023, returned 2024-25.
The $2.2M target requires Dolphin count expansion from ~30 to 40+ projects, plus sustained Whale volume. The most realistic path is Dolphin count growth through the Portfolio Program.

2024→2025 Customer Flow:
- 22 of 66 (33%) FY2024 customers retained. Retained customers increased spend 67% ($318K → $530K).
- 44 customers churned ($512K lost). 53 new customers acquired ($610K). Net positive but thin.
- Growth requires both expansion (retained) and acquisition (new). Neither alone is sufficient.
The 4.7x lifetime value multiplier for repeat customers is the core economic argument for the Portfolio Program.


### 3.4 Sales Cycle & Conversion
Median sales cycle: 11 days from first estimate to first invoice. 71% close within 30 days; 42.5% within 1 week. Deals past 30 days are statistically dying (only 16% of conversions happen after 91+ days). This is a triage problem, not a nurture problem — stalled deals need direct call, scope reframe, or kill.

Pre-qualified buyers with budget authority
Multi-estimate customers produce 5.6x the revenue of single-estimate customers ($46,752 avg vs $8,316). These are complex scope decisions that resolve into the biggest deals, not tire-kickers.
Scope accuracy: 56.8% of deals land within +/-10% of estimate (tight estimating). 17.9% invoice 50%+ more than estimate — uncaptured upsell from change orders and add-on disciplines.
Lost pipeline: $13.4M in unconverted estimates across 202 customers. 913 estimates in "Pending" status — functionally a graveyard, not a pipeline. No systematic win/loss tracking exists.
Contact data quality: 541 contacts in QB. 91% have email (good). 3% have phone (limits outbound). 6% have billing address (limits geographic analysis).

Key trends:
- Commercial LoD 300 is the franchise — 18% → 40% of revenue in one year ($998K). Core SKU for enterprise positioning.
- MEPF LoD 300 is the growth add-on — tripled from 1.9% → 6.3%. Validates multi-discipline upsell strategy.
- Residential is shrinking as share — 37% → 22%. Volume still present but price compression limits ceiling. Consistent with enterprise pivot.
- LoD 200 is dying across all categories — clients choosing higher-fidelity deliverables. Higher LoD = higher margin.
- Structural emerging — combined 300+350 grew from 2.6% to 4.0%. Early signal for multi-discipline packages.
- CAD packages declining — 3.3% → 1.7%. Industry moving to Revit-native delivery.


### 3.6 Pricing Structure
Pricing Philosophy
Price = f(Building Type, LoD Standard, Square Footage, Disciplines, Add-ons). Price based on sqft estimate; final cost determined by actual sqft scanned and modeled via BOMA Gross Area Standard audit delivered ~1 week after scan. Transparent, auditable, and a differentiator.
Canonical pricing lives in the Pricing Matrix spreadsheet. The ranges below are for ballpark estimation only — not for quoting.
Pricing Paths
Path
Used For
Method
Path 1: $/sqft Lookup
Minnow + Dolphin projects
Building Type x SF Band x Discipline x LoD → rate from matrix
Path 2: Whale Costing
Whale projects (50K+ SF)
Bottom-up cost estimation + margin multipliers
Ballpark Ranges (All-In Client Price, Not Internal Rates)
Published range: $0.02 to $2.00 per square foot — 100x range reflecting real difference between high-volume portfolio scanning and complex single-building heritage documentation.
Typical project ranges by tier:
- Minnow (3-10K SF): $2,500-$10,000
- Dolphin (10-50K SF): $10,000-$50,000
- Whale (50K+ SF): $50,000+
LoD 350 requires 40-60% more effort than LoD 300 for the same scope. Premium reflects additional craft knowledge for interface conditions.

Landscape Pricing
$140-$1,250 per acre depending on acreage, landscape type, and LoD. Built landscape (manicured, human-modified) runs ~25-40% premium over natural landscape (forests, waterways, unmaintained). Rates decrease significantly with scale — 100+ acre projects price at roughly 15-20% of small-parcel rates. $300 minimum charge.
Subcontractor Reference (BuildScan 3D)
NavVis up to 100K SF: $3,500 flat. Over 100K SF: custom quote. Used for Whale projects to preserve internal X7 crew capacity.
Custom Rate Cards
Available for clients with recurring project types. Client provides typical building types, sqft ranges, disciplines, LoD requirements, and expected annual volume. S2P provides calibrated rate card for rapid budgeting without individual quotes.
SKU Catalog
62 approved line items across 6 categories: Scan-to-BIM (by LoD), CAD Packages (by LoD), Discipline Add-Ons (Structural, MEPF, Landscape, Grade), Specialty Services (19 items including Paper-to-BIM, ArchiCAD, FEA, Georeferencing, Drone), Commercial packages, and surcharges. No SKU sprawl — quotes use canonical catalog only.
Note: Scan-to-CAD as a standalone product line has been discontinued. CAD conversion from Revit models remains available.
Pricing Operating Targets (P1)
- Proposal build time: median under 15 minutes once stable
- Adoption: ≥95% of quotes originate from intake for 30 consecutive days
- CO triggers paragraph included in every proposal
- GM-glance logged on ≥95% of quotes
- Travel is not negotiable per job (margin leakage prevention)
- No "creative discounts" outside rules library
Price-Match Challenge
Structured comparison form that forces competitor proposals into S2P's evaluation framework across 5 categories: Point Cloud Accuracy, BIM Model Standards, CAD Deliverable Standards, Georeferencing Standards, QA Documentation & Support. Forces binary QUALIFIES / DOES NOT QUALIFY outcome. This form is the price-match guarantee mechanism — a deployed competitive weapon that reframes every competitor's proposal through S2P's standards lens.



### 3.7 Margin & Cost Structure
Dual-View Gross Margin Framework
S2P operates two parallel financial models. Both correct. They answer different questions.
Framework
Gross Margin
Purpose

## Gaap
~56% (range 54-63%)
External reporting. True project profitability. Pricing decisions.
Profit First
35-38% (budget allocation)
Internal budgeting. Cash management. Treats more categories as cost.
Rule: When discussing gross margin externally or in pricing decisions, use GAAP (~56%). When discussing internal cash allocation or budget planning, reference Profit First. Always name which framework is cited.
Revenue Allocation — Where Every Dollar Goes
S2P uses a Profit First allocation model that accounts for 100% of revenue across 12 categories. GAAP gross margin (~56%) is a diagnostic output of this model, not the operating framework.

Variable vs fixed-% distinction matters for pricing: When S2P raises prices, Buckets 1-4 (scanning, travel, registration, modeling) stay flat in absolute dollars because the work doesn't change. The COGS percentage drops, and the savings percentage increases. This is the primary mechanism for improving margins.
GAAP Cost Classification
Litmus test for COGS: if the project did not exist, would this cost disappear?
Cost of Services (COGS — 41% target): Buckets 1-7 above. Range 37-46% depending on project mix, scanner type, and travel.
Operating Expenses (below gross profit): Owen salary (management), Chase revenue partner 2%, Agata salary, Drayton base salary, S&M budget, Rent, Software, Insurance, Pro Services, Equipment Depreciation.
Non-Operating: Interest expense on debt, tax reserve (15% per ASC 740).
Note: Drayton's salary stays in overhead (OpEx). QC hours tracked for visibility but not charged to COGS.
The Multiplier
S2P does not price by calculating overhead markups and margin markups separately. The actual process:
- Estimate total COGS (Scan + Travel + Reg + Model + QC + PM + COO/CTO)
- Apply a multiplier to get the price
- The multiplier is the only dial Owen turns

~10% (target)
Current operation: Price = (Scan Cost + Reg Cost + Model Cost) x 2.352, where 2.352 = 1.68 (overhead multiplier) x 1.4 (40% markup). Production base = Revenue / 2.352 = 42.5% of revenue. The remaining 57.5% covers QC, PM, COO, overhead, margin, taxes, S&M, and debt reserves. 2.352 is the absolute minimum. Actual effective multipliers typically run higher.
Target evolution: Shift multiplier base from production-only (3 buckets) to total COGS (7 buckets). This gives a more accurate cost picture and lets Owen set the multiplier with confidence. The Scan Heuristic Tracker (v1, structure defined) is the key enabler — once calibrated with 10+ projects per building type, COGS estimates replace judgment with data.
Owen adjusts the multiplier deal by deal based on competitive pressure, relationship value, and strategic importance. The floor protects margin. The ceiling is what the market bears.
Price Increase Mechanics
When S2P raises prices on the same scope of work, variable-cost buckets (scanning, travel, registration, modeling) stay flat in absolute dollars. Fixed-% buckets (QC, PM, COO/CTO) scale with revenue. The net effect: COGS % drops, savings % increases.
                    $10K revenue     $12K revenue (+20%, same work)
Scan                $800 (8.0%)      $800 (6.7%)
Travel              $100 (1.0%)      $100 (0.8%)

Savings delta       $400 (4.0%)      $1,090 (9.1%)
Raising prices is the primary lever for reaching the 10% savings target.
GM Gate
- Hard gate: >=40% GM at proposal (commit), 45% on closed-won (stretch).
- Enforced in CPQ calculator (S2POS).
- Tier-A scanning subcontracted to BuildScan 3D to preserve internal X7 crew capacity.
- Internal X7 capacity: 40 scan-days/month (full months), 30 in Nov, 20 in Dec/Jul/Aug.

### 3.9 Market Position
Current ICP
Small-to-midsize renovation architecture firms (5-50 person), residential and light commercial, NYC/Hudson Valley, repeat relationship-driven, budget range $3K-$30K/project.
Aspirational ICP (Tier-A)
Top 50 US architecture firms by revenue (Gensler $1.86B through Woolpert $89M), multi-site programs, vendor-approved relationships, $50K+ projects, portfolio standardization deals.
Wedge Strategy
Use current reputation and Proof Vault to break into Tier-A firms. Not replacing current ICP — adding layer above. ABM targeting specific offices within mega-firms, not whole firm at once.
APV Trend
$6,283 (FY2021-2024 avg) → $11,402 (FY2025), +81% growth. FY2026 target: +50% over FY2025 baseline, driven by Tier-A project mix shift.
Competitive Moat
- 7.5-year production relationship with 40-person dedicated modeling team — depth of bench with consistency nobody else has
- 1,000+ buildings scanned and documented since 2018 (632 active projects in S2POS, plus 400+ Matterport-era projects from 2018-2020)
- LoD/LoA dual-standard declaration (most competitors don't declare LoA at all)
- 12-Point Assurance Standard with Certificate of Assurance (no competitor offers this)
- Owen's domain expertise and relationship network
- Practice Forward podcast — 33 episodes with 33 firm principals (dormant, FY2026 reactivation planned)
- Proprietary BIM Modeling Standards matrix (LoD 200/300/350/350+ by element across 4 disciplines)
Competitive Vulnerabilities
- Single-closer dependency (Owen)
- No systematic win/loss tracking
- Website doesn't reflect current capabilities (2022 vintage; P21 refresh targeting May 2026)
- No 360 photo solution competitive with best-in-class (acknowledged gap)
- Price not lowest in market (positioned as quality premium)
- 3% phone coverage in contact database — limits outbound
- $5-10K and $25-50K deal sizes are conversion kill zones
