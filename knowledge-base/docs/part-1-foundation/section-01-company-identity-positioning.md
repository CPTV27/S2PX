## 🏛️ Section 1: Company Identity & Positioning
Legal Entity
- Name: Scan2Plan, Inc.
- Structure: C Corporation (Delaware)
- Founded: 2018
- HQ: Troy, NY | Additional hub: Brooklyn, NY
- Phone: (518) 362-2403

What We Are
LiDAR-to-BIM/CAD documentation firm delivering Revit models, AutoCAD drawings, colorized point clouds, and 360 photo documentation at declared LoD and LoA for architects, engineers, contractors, and facility owners who need reliable existing conditions data.
Specialization
Renovation, adaptive reuse, and historic preservation — buildings where accurate as-built documentation is the difference between confident design and costly surprises.
Category
As-Built Assurance — not "scan-to-BIM services." S2P doesn't sell scans. It guarantees existing-conditions certainty that design and construction can safely stand on.
Core Promise
"Guaranteed Certainty, From Capture to Coordination."

Mission, Vision & Values
Mission: To deliver trust, confidence, and integrity on every project.
- Trust = transparency (document methods, validate accuracy, define limitations explicitly)
- Confidence = proven standards (every deliverable meets measurable criteria with objective evidence)
- Integrity = accountability (stand behind work with defined support commitments and honest communication)
Vision: Scan2Plan is the measure of excellence for Architects and Engineers.
Core Values:
- We Care — empathy and client-first service
- Can Do — solutions-driven mindset
- Continual Improvement — relentless pursuit of innovation and refinement

The Problem We Solve
The scan-to-BIM industry suffers from an accountability crisis. Buyers receive deliverables labeled "LoD 300" with no validation evidence, unclear accuracy standards, mystery coordinates, and no defined support. Six common failures S2P exists to eliminate:
Failure
What Happens
Undefined LoD
"Detailed model" without specifying elements, geometry level, or validation method
Unvalidated Accuracy
"High accuracy" claims without registration reports, RMS residuals, or overlap metrics
Mystery Coordinates
Models with arbitrary origins; no coordinate system documentation; civil/GIS integration impossible
Silent Voids
Point clouds with undocumented gaps; clients assume complete coverage
No Acceptance Criteria
No defined process for determining whether deliverables meet requirements
Absent Support
"Not our responsibility" or "additional fee" when issues arise after delivery
These failures are systemic — they exist because the industry lacks accountability frameworks. S2P's 12-Point Assurance Standard explicitly addresses every one.

The Three Guarantees
Enforceable commitments written into every scope of work.
1. Transparency & Standards "We define, designate, and deliver LoD & LoA on every project — backed by our 12-Point Assurance Standard."
- Before work begins: deliverables, LoD per discipline, LoA for cloud and model, coordinate basis, datum, control, registration metrics, coverage limits, assumptions, acceptance criteria, and support scope — all documented in writing.
- After delivery: validation evidence via QA Packets (registration reports, overlap metrics, coverage maps, assumption logs).
- Targets: Point cloud LoA-40 (≤1/8" / ≤3mm RMS). Model LoA-30 (≤1/2" / ≤12mm positional accuracy).
2. Price-Match "If they can match our standards, we'll match their price."
- Competitor must define LoD by discipline, LoA per USIBD, and validation methodology with registration reports and overlap metrics. If they can't or won't define standards, they don't qualify.
3. Lifetime Support "Assistance for the life of the project — unlimited revisions within scope."
- Included: corrections to errors within LoD/LoA, file format assistance, coordinate clarification, technical support, guidance on using deliverables.
- Change order: adding areas, upgrading LoD, adding disciplines, re-scanning changed conditions.
- File retention: indefinite. No time limits, no storage fees.

The Three Uniques
Unique
What It Means
The Measure of Excellence
LoD, LoA, and QC standards are measurable commitments with objective evidence. "LoA-40 point cloud" comes with registration reports proving it.
Tailored to Your Needs
Flexible LoD, LoA, and file format options per project. Help client specify the appropriate level — not the maximum level.
Ready When You Are
Proposal within 24 hours. Field mobilization within 1 week. Model delivery in 2-5 weeks.

Messaging Pillars
Pillar
Core Message
P1 Focus on Design
Remove documentation burden so architects design
P2 Certainty Lies in Good Data
Standards-first; point cloud as single-source-of-truth
P3 As-Built Assurance
Documents withstand review; Certificate of Assurance with 12-point verification
P4 Tailored to Your Needs
Fit-for-purpose LoD levels; client template adoption
P5 Ready When You Are
High-touch responsiveness; scanning within 1 week
P6 Save the Buildings
Sustainability-aligned, emotionally resonant. "The greenest building is the one already built."

What We Promise vs What We Don't
We promise:
- Point cloud accuracy validated to LoA-40 with registration reports proving it
- BIM model accuracy at LoA-30 for elements within contracted scope
- LoD specifications documented and met for each discipline
- Coverage limitations documented with reasons (not silent voids)
- Assumptions explicitly identified (not hidden)
- QA Packet with validation evidence accompanying every deliverable
- Unlimited support for documented scope
We don't promise:
- Concealed conditions (inside walls, above inaccessible ceilings, below grade)
- Elements below MEP sizing thresholds unless specifically contracted
- Material specifications or conditions beyond visible geometry
- Areas not scanned due to access restrictions (documented in QA Packet)
- Perfect orthogonal geometry (real buildings aren't orthogonal)
- Structural capacity, code compliance, or engineering certifications

Sustainability & Preservation
Adaptive reuse minimizes waste, conserves embodied energy, and reduces emissions. S2P services preserve cultural heritage while mitigating environmental impact. "The greenest building is the one already built." Only ~4-5% of competitors in the scan-to-BIM space mention sustainability at all.

FY2026 Strategy (One Sentence)
Scan2Plan wins in 2026 by using proof, standards, and disciplined pricing to convert enterprise architects into larger, repeatable programs through targeted ABM and education.
