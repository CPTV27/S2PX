# PART IV: BRAND SYSTEMS & COMMUNICATION

## Brand Voice & Lexicon

- **Tone:** Confident, precise, proof-first. Not salesy. Explains Scan2Plan's superiority from within the industry as a peer.
- **Say / Don't Say:**
  - Say: "declared LoD and LoA" | Don't Say: "guaranteed accuracy"
  - Say: "existing conditions documentation" | Don't Say: "as-built" (unless quoting convention)
  - Say: "Measure of Excellence" | Don't Say: "best in class"

## Banned Patterns

Content must never include:

- ROI claims without sourced precedent.
- Future features presented as current capabilities.
- Empty superlatives ("industry-leading," "world-class").
- Leading with "fast & accurate" (universal claims).

## Copy Validation Pipeline

All content must pass four cognitive modes before publication:

1. **Industry Skeptic:** Would this convince a 30-year AEC veteran?
2. **Mark Twain:** Are there any unnecessary words or jargon?
3. **Buckminster Fuller:** Is the claim mapped to a systemic industry inefficiency?
4. **Industry Advocate:** Is the claim fully supportable by S2P's verified data?
